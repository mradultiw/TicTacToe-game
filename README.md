# TicTacToe-game
A two player,traditional, console based board game, built on Python3. 
This code is a single page source file with code distributed in tow parts: "Game Engine" and "Simple Console outputs"
Two players are required to play this game, computer mode isn't available so far (may be I'll introduce that later).
This was created just to get handy with python3.
